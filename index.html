  <h2>Exhibit Overview</h2>
  <p>This exhibit explores how DMX gives voice to working-class Black men whose anger, vulnerability, and spirituality are often dismissed or feared.</p>

  <h2>The Silenced Voice</h2>
  <p>Black pain, anger, and spiritual conflict have often been criminalized or silenced in American culture. DMX challenges this erasure by presenting suffering and prayer side by side, insisting that vulnerability and faith can coexist with rage.</p>

      <h2>Artifact I: Album Cover — <em>It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot</em> (1998)</h2>
      <p>The album cover of It's Dark and Hell is Hot (1998) showcase the emotional turmoil of DMX and his long awaited debut. The devil-tailed lettering showcases his internal struggle of faith vs despair, reflecting the lived experiences of many black men who were navigating trauma and guilt of the late 90s. The blood stained image brings a new perspective to viewers and listeners that reject material and earthly possessions, a theme that mainstream hip-hop was pushing. The cover rebukes stereotypes that reduced marginalized black men to either violent gang members or wasted beggars on the street. </p>

      <h2>Artifact II: "Damien" Pt. I, II, III (1998-2001)</h2>
      <p>The Damien Trilogy shows DMX having a conversation with a demonic character represented by Damien, symbolizing temptation and moral struggle between sin and faith. The song gives voice to marginalized black men who navigate trauma and mental warfare on a daily basis. The track challenges stereotypes that portray black men as tough and violent, rather suggesting that inner vulnerability and faith in God are central to fighting temptation and the devil.  </p>

      <h2>Artifact III: “Prayers” (1998-2021)</h2>
      <p>DMX is well known for openly praying at his concerts, showcasing his unique voice and style of vulnerability in his conversation with the Lord. These prayers represent the lived experience of many black men, torn between faith, humility, violence, and ego. Through openly praying in front of hundreds of thousands, DMX's prayers reject stereotypes for black men that strength comes from aggression and volume, rather than openness and vulnerability with God.</p>

      <h2>Artifact IV: "Lord Give Me A Sign" (2006)</h2>
      <p>Through "Lord Give Me A Sign", DMX is having a conversation with God, rebuking the devil and asking the Lord for guidance and strength while amidst personal struggles with his faith. The song represents experiences that black men face on the daily, struggling to keep their faith in a society that labels them as gangsters. The song rejects stereotypes that black men are linked to, as they are often labeled as thugs and criminals, instead shedding light and rejecting that narrative through faith and vulnerability.
